📌 Overview
This project is designed to classify garbage into different categories such as organic, recyclable, hazardous, and non-recyclable using machine learning and/or deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist in automated waste sorting to promote efficient recycling and proper disposal practices.

🎯 Main Objective
To develop a system that accurately classifies images of garbage into appropriate categories using computer vision techniques.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

OpenCV

Scikit-learn

Flask / Streamlit (for web app)

Jupyter Notebook

LabelImg (for annotation if object detection is used)

📊 Dataset
Public datasets like:

TrashNet

Waste Classification Dataset on Kaggle

Categories: Plastic, Paper, Glass, Metal, Organic, E-waste, Others
